# nycWeatherPatterns

This program pulls from NYC open sourced data. The records date back to 1868 all the way to June of 2023.
Using PANDAS and Seaborns, I was able to analyze the rise of temperature from 1868 till 2023 and used that pattern to predict how the next 150 years would look.

I've included the excel file with the records (I created a T_AVG column just by using the MIN and MAx temps from each day), and the colab notebook used to make the magic happen :)
